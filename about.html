                <p>As a UX designer, I have dedicated my career to creating intuitive and impactful experiences for users. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on several design fronts, including graphic design, motion, illustration, and now I've found myself in research and interface design. I always try to be as adaptive as possible in the areas I work in, keeping myself organized and constantly looking for improvements, contributing to the growth of the project and the team as a whole. My goal is to exceed expectations, delivering memorable interfaces and experiences.</p>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design and Social Communication from ESAMC, where I gained in-depth knowledge of visual language, accurate aesthetic sense, and expertise in graphic technology. The rigorous training at ESAMC enabled me to manage multidisciplinary teams and develop a deep understanding of the market. My education provided me with a solid foundation in graphic design and marketing, further enhanced by specific projects that connected diverse disciplines to meet current market demands.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I completed a UX Design Certificate at Digital House Brasil, where I learned about the design and construction cycle of digital products, following the User Centered Design approach. This program enriched my ability to create user-centric designs, focusing on delivering seamless and engaging user experiences.</p>
